## 🏆 What MCP Does Best

1. **Contract Generation** - Production-ready code instantly
2. **Project Scaffolding** - Excellent guidance to official tools
3. **Deployment Guides** - Comprehensive instructions
4. **Network Data** - Instant blockchain queries

---

## ⚠️ Where MCP Falls Short

1. **Frontend Code** - Too basic, had to write 90% manually
2. **Documentation** - Search mostly broken
3. **Contract Wrappers** - Not available (critical feature)

## 💡 Key Insight

**MCP is excellent for backend/contracts but needs major improvement for frontend.**

The contract generation alone makes it valuable, but frontend generation needs to be production-ready to be truly useful.
